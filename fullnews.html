                    <p>
                        <img class="fullnews-img" src="img/Tool-Image_tcm1010-41320.jpg">
                        
                        SABIC, a global leader in the chemical industry, today introduced SABIC® PP compound H1090 resin
                        and STAMAX™ 30YH611 resin, two breakthrough materials well-suited for sheet extrusion and
                        thermoforming that offer a unique alternative to traditional sheet metal forming, compression
                        and injection molding, allowing customers to form large, complex structural parts.
                
                        These new products are 30 percent glass fiber-reinforced, intumescent, flame retardant (FR)
                        materials, based on polypropylene (PP), and can be used for electric vehicle (EV) battery pack
                        components such as top covers, enclosures and module separators. Both grades offer excellent
                        thermal barrier properties to help delay or contain thermal runaway propagation. Furthermore,
                        the extrusion and thermoforming of these materials offer design, system cost, inherent thermal
                        and electrical insulation and weight advantages vs. stamped sheet metal. Compared to injection
                        molding of thermoplastics and compression molding for thermosets, which requires expensive
                        tooling and equipment, extrusion and thermoforming can be more cost-effective and efficient for
                        several cases.
                
                        SABIC’s development and validation of these new materials is made possible by BLUEHERO™, an
                        initiative that supports the automotive industry’s mission to create reliable, safe and
                        efficient EVs, with an emphasis on helping optimize structural battery components. BLUEHERO
                        leverages, among other things, SABIC’s knowledge of and expertise in large part molding,
                        compression molding, thermoforming and advanced injection molding.
                
                        According to Abdullah Al-Otaibi, general manager, ETP & Market Solutions, SABIC: “By providing
                        new alternatives to traditional materials and processes, SABIC can enable customers to design
                        and manufacture the next generation of battery components while driving down costs and gaining a
                        competitive advantage. Our experts have helped pioneer the successful adaptation of glass
                        fiber-reinforced materials for the extrusion and thermoforming of large, complex, structural
                        parts. The development and validation of these novel resins showcase SABIC’s leadership in
                        polymer technologies for vehicle electrification.”
                
                        SABIC has validated the mechanical and fire safety performance and the manufacturability of
                        SABIC PP compound H1090 resin and STAMAX 30YH611 resin in EV battery applications with complex
                        geometries, both in its labs and with customers. These materials not only provide new options
                        for the replacement of sheet metal or thermosets in final applications, they can also be used to
                        create prototypes to determine the feasibility of investing in injection molding tools.
